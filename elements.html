								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ilir.png" alt="" /></span>The founder Iliriana K, came up with this idea while in university as part of project. At first it was just a fun idea. But as time passed this idea came in to life and became biger then anyone could imagine. Majority of the people in the team in the begining were artist, which helped to have a prespective of an artist. And from the eye of the artists we saw the big need for a space like Illyrian Gallery. A space that helps new artist to have a platform that helps them to kickstart their career. Seeing as the saying "starving artist" has always affected a lot of people, we wanted to change that mentality and give artist a chance to profit off their work and become more succesful.</p>
